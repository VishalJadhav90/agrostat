A crowd sourced statistics framework for farm produce.

Use Case 
  In India when a farmer decides to plant vegetables the amount of data regarding how much area is under cultivation for same vegetable is not known. So far there is no mean by which farmer can know historical trends in prices of vegetables.
  
  Absence of reliable and easy to use statistics causes farmer to take chance when it comes to planting vegetables, often such plantation with absence of any reference data leads huge cultivation of same kind of vegetable by majority of farmers, which ultimately leads to crash in prices. 
  
  A crowdsourced statistics framework will gather data from farmers via mobile app in the form of
  1. Vegetable type under cultivation
  2. Price received by farmer for vegetable 
  3. Area under cultivation for particular vegetable type
  4. And further aspects viz. seed variety name, quantity of produce.  
  
Such crowdsourced statistics framework can be used by farmers to check amount of farmers cultivating particular type of vegetable before he decides to plant that vegetable, which ultimately avoid the overproduction of same kind of vegetable. 

Historical statistics can help farmer to understand price spike period and quantity of production during different times through the year; which will help him to plan right time for cultivation of vegetables. 

Building Blocks
  1. A smartphone app to gather data from farmers.
